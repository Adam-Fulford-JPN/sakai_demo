    <h2>Kofun dessert</h2>
    <p>Sakai is famous for its many burial mounds dating back to the Kofun (burial mound) period between the 3rd and 7th centuries. Most impressive of all is an especially massive ancient mausoleum called the Daisen Kofun, which is believed to be the resting place of Emperor Nintoku. You need to be in an aircraft to get a clear sense of Daisen Kofun, and that's how this photo was taken. In this photo, Daisen Kofun the big green area in the background. You can see other smaller kofun, too. The Daisen Kofun site is off-limits to the public, but you can view it from the observatory at City Hall, where you will find this photo on the wall. You can also walk or run around the giant kofun's 3-km perimeter. And you can eat it, for example in the form of a kofun-shaped dessert or monaka wafer.</p>
